# BDML_CIFAR-10
Performing Supervised Learning on CIFAR-10 dataset

# Introduction
In this report, we will compare 2 learning algorithms using the given CIFAR-10 dataset. We will study the time used, percentage accuracy and with more different angles of the classifier.

# Method
Since the labels of the data are given, so we will use the supervised learning classifications. The methods used are Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Neural Networks. 

# Conclusion
To conclude, different classifiers have their advantages. In order to choose the best fit algorithm for a specific project, we need to understand their benefits and drawbacks of the classifier
